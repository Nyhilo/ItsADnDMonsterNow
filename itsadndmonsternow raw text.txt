Spellcasting. The acolyte is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): Control Flames, Create Fire, Firebolt, Mage Hand
1st level (4 slots): Burning Hands, Chromatic Orb (using fire damage exclusively), Mage Armor, Shield
2nd level (3 slots): Darkness, Flaming Sphere, Scorching Ray
3rd level (3 slots): Blink, Fireball, Gaseous Form, Tongues
Flame Weapon (3/Short or Long Rest). As an action, the acolyte conjures a bladed weapon made from searing hot energy. This weapon can be a dagger, shortsword, or longsword, and lasts for 10 minutes, or until dismissed as a free action. This weapon deals weapon damage appropriate for its form, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage. This fire damage is also applied any time a creature other than the acolyte comes in physical contact with the blade.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The acolyte makes two melee attacks, or one melee attack and uses one cantrip, in either order.
Flame Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage if wielded with two hands, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
Flame Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
Flame Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', or range (20'/60') if thrown, one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
Ashes to Ashes (Recharge 6). When the acolyte is hit by an attack, it may use its reaction to become an incorporeal cloud of smoke and ashes (any equipment or carried objects are transformed along with it). While in this form, it cannot speak or interact with creatures or objects, it is resistant to nonmagical damage, and loses all movement speeds, replaced by a fly speed of 10'. This effect ends at the end of its next turn, or when the acolyte chooses to end it as a free action.

Amphibious. The octopus can breathe both air and water.
Camouflage. The coloration and texture of the octopus' skin and its thin, rope-like tentacles allow it to hide easily in forests and swamps. The octopus has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide while in these environments, and Perception checks made to find it while it is motionless in such areas have disadvantage.
Forest and Swamp Walk. The octopus has adapted to movement through thick forests and swamps. Difficult terrain resulting from swampy conditions, plant undergrowth, or any other nonmagical phenomena in these environments does not cost the octopus extra movement. Additionally, while climbing in a tree, if there is another tree capable of supporting the octopus' weight within its reach, it may spend movement normally to move directly from one tree to another.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The octopus makes two melee attacks.
Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) piercing damage.
Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 15', one target.Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the octopus can't grapple another target. The octopus may use this attack against an already-grappled target as a bonus action.
Ink Spray (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). Thick, sticky ink is sprayed out in a 20' cone extending from the octopus, and any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in ink. A creature coated in ink is blinded, and its movement speed is reduced by 10'. A creature coated in ink may use an action to attempt to wipe itself off by making a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check, removing the ink and its effects on a success.
  After using Ink Spray on its turn, the octopus may, as a bonus action, either use the Dash action, or make a Tentacles attack during that turn.

Antimagic Susceptibility. The tumbler is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by a Dispel Magic spell, the tumbler must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
Semiautonomous. In most circumstances, the tumbler does not intelligently navigate its surroundings, instead heedlessly following the direction of the wind. However if a creature in possession of the tumbler's control artifact can telepathically issue commands to it, which it is compelled to follow mindlessly.
Trap Trigger. The tumbler is enchanted in a way that allows it to trigger traps of all kinds. If a trap is triggered upon entering a specific area, or making contact with a particular surface or object, the Tumbler qualifies as meeting that criteria immediately upon doing so, even if the trap would normally also require a certain creature type, action, code word, artifact, etc.

Keen Smell. The cockroach has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
Makeshift Armor. Either by cunning or coincidence, the cockroach has managed to cover itself with some metal debris which acts as makeshift armor. A creature that has the cockroach grappled can use its action to remove the metal, at which point the cockroach's AC is reduced to 12.
Wings. When the cockroach uses the Dash action, it can choose to use its wings to gain a fly speed of 30' for the duration of the dash. If the cockroach is airborne at the end of the dash, it immediately falls back to earth.

--Actions--
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

 

Variant: Armored Giant Radiant Cockroach
Replace the cockroach's Bite attack with the following:
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) radiant damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the radiant damage done. The target's hit point maximum is restored to normal after a long rest, or by a lesser restoration spell.
If using this variant, the creature's CR is increased to 2 (450 XP).

Antimagic Susceptibility. The bison is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the bison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
Charge. If the bison moves at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, that target takes an extra 6 (1d12) bludgeoning damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Siege Monster. The bison deals double damage to objects and structures.
Stampede. The bison may ready an action to use Ram or Charge in unison with one or more other Artifice Bisons. If it does so, each bison that attacks in unison this way has advantage on its attack roll if they share the same target, or if their targets are within 10' of each other.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The bison makes an attack with its hooves, followed by a Headbutt attack.
Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
Hooves. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit:12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. This attack may be used as a bonus action against a target who is prone.

Keen Smell. The bear has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.
Inconspicuous Silhouette. While remaining completely motionless, the bear can make a Stealth check to hide, even if it is in plain sight. The bear gains advantage on this check if it is in dim light and/or in a wooded area.

Adept Swimmer. The penguin adds double its proficiency bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made for swimming, and doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it swims out of an enemy’s reach. Additionally, the penguin doubles its Dexterity bonus to AC while swimming.
Clumsy Walker. The penguin is not as graceful on land as it is in the water. When on standing on solid ground, the penguin has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws as well as Strength saving throws against any effect that would knock it prone.
Cold Acclimation. The penguin suffers no adverse effects from cold environments due to temperatures as low as -50°F.
Hold Breath. The penguin can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

Though instinctively leery of outsiders, the awakened penguins of the polar regions are persistently even-tempered, and generous to those few whom they trust. As they are quite awkward and vulnerable on solid ground, they prefer to congregate near ledges overlooking the open water, where at the first sign of danger they can flee into the water and make a hasty escape using their incredibly swimming ability.

Challenge 13 (10,000 XP)

Antimagic Cone. The beholder's giant eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150' cone. At the start of each of its turns , the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.
High-Altitude Flying. The beholder prefers to fly at great heights, attacking creatures from outside of the reach of their attacks. This is typically among the stalactites near the ceiling of their Underdark home, but it's not impossible for them to fly in open air above the surface. When doing so, the beholder is considered to be acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000' and suffers no penalties from cold temperatures resulting from such altitudes.

--Actions--
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 19 (4d8 + 1) piercing damage.
Eye Barrage. This specific beholder has the same kinds of eyestalks found on a typical specimen, but instead of sprouting from around the top of its head, they are positioned downward so as to cover the ground far below. Likewise, while this beholder's eyestalks also possess the ability to dispense powerful magic, it is delivered in a substantially different way: Rather than shooting eye rays, the beholder looses spheres of magical energy which drop from its current altitude onto targets below, exploding on contact and releasing their destructive magic in a radius from their point of impact.
  The beholder lobs three of the following magical eye attacks at random (reroll duplicates), targeting one to three points it can see on the ground within a radius equal to 10' out from the point directly beneath the beholder, plus an additional 5' for every 10' of altitude the beholder has above the surface. After choosing the target points, each attack scatters (in a random direction) a distance equal to 5' multiplied by (1d3 - 1) for every 50' of altitude the beholder has above the surface. Each attack explodes in a 5'-radius sphere area centered on its final point of impact.
Charm Blast. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.
Paralyzing Blast. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Fear Blast. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Slowing Blast. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Enervation Blast. Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Telekinetic Blast. If a target in the area is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw be levitated 5' off the ground, without any direct control over its movement. It is restrained by this telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.
  If the target is an object weighing 300lbs or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is levitated up to 30' upwards and up to 15' in a random horizontal direction until the start of the beholder's next turn, when it falls to the ground.
Sleep Blast. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. A target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.
Petrification Blast. Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure , the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
Disintegration Blast. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.
  Large or smaller nonmagical objects or creations of magical force in the area are disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10' cube of it.
Death Blast. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.

--Legendary Actions--
The beholder can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Barrage option below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The beholder regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Eye Barrage. The beholder uses one random eye attack.

Variant: Eye Barrage from higher than 600'
Since the beholder's attacks are moved by gravity, they don't truly possess a maximum range, aside from how high the beholder itself can fly. However, while both the vertical and horizontal ranges of the attack increase the higher the beholder flies, so too does the distance these attacks will scatter, and the time it takes for them to reach the ground.
  If a beholder makes an Eye Barrage attack from a height of 600' or greater, in addition to the average scatter distance of 60', the attacks also take an entire round to reach the target. If the beholder attacks in this way, the action made to do so is spent and the final impact point of the attack is resolved, but the attack isn't resolved until the start of the beholder's next turn. If the attack was made as part of one of the beholder's legendary actions, the attack is resolved after one round has passed, at the same order in initiative as the attack was initiated.
  While one or more of the beholder's attacks are in flight, a creature can make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the plummeting spheres of magic, and gauge their point of impact, possibly giving the warning needed to avoid the blast area.

Ambusher. The spider has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.
False Appearance. The spider is able to mimic a crawling, distressed humanoid female in a white cloak with the aid of its general form and coloration, some subtle movements, and even a soft whimpering or moaning sound. Any creature that can hear or see the spider while it is assuming this facade must succeed on a Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by the spider's Charisma (Deception) check. Any creature who fails this contest perceives the spider exactly as its disguise implies until within 5' of the spider, at which point a creature can make the contest again, with advantage.
Spider Climb. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Web Walker. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

Multiattack. The spider makes three attacks: one with its bite, and two with its claws.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one creature. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one creature. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) piercing damage.

Antimagic Cone. The beholder-mimic's giant eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the anti magic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns , the beholder-mimic decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.
Shapechanger. The beholder-mimic can use its action to polymorph into an object or back into its true, chest-like form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
Multiple Eyes. While in its true form, the beholder-mimic's multiple eyes grant it advantage on saying throws against any effect that would blind it.
Contents. The beholder-mimic's natural shape is a hexagonal box. Its mouth contains a large cavity which often holds valuable items carried by its prey. Additionally, powerful wizards will also keep these creatures around to use as self-securing storage for their most precious treasures.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The beholder-mimic makes three consecutive Bite attacks against a single target.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 19 (4d8 + 1) piercing damage.
Eye Rays. In its natural form, the beholder-mimic has six eye sockets, one at each of its corners. While in this form, it may use an action to shoot one of the following magical eye rays at random at a target it can see within 120 feet of it:
Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.
Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.
Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.

Illusory Appearance. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
  The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

--Reactions--
Phantasmal Escape (Recharge 5-6). If the hag is hit by a melee or ranged attack, she can use her reaction to cast misty step, and then immediately make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to Hide as part of that same reaction.

  If the tortoise receives 10 or more bludgeoning damage from a single attack, the intense reverberations actually force it from its shell entirely. While the tortoise is no longer in its shell, its AC is reduced to 8, its speed increases by 10', and it loses its Shell Ram attack. The tortoise can re-enter its shell as an action from a space within 5' of it.

Challenge 10 base, variable from 11 (7,200 XP) to 15 (13,000 XP) -- seeAmalgamation trait below

Amalgamation. Demonic amalgams are reprehensible creations, conjured into life at the behest of greater demons who seek a living tool whose sole purpose is not only to lay waste to armies or settlements, but also to leave any survivors irreparably scarred by their horror. They are demonic entities comprised of forms borrowed from many different types of demons, and the ritual necessary for their creation is so difficult and violently random that those performing it will often forgo any delusion of control, simply allowing the wild sorceries involved to shape the creature as they will.
   The DM chooses or rolls for 4 (2d2 + 1) traits from various types of demons, as shown on the table below, re-rolling any duplicates. For each demon type added, the Amalgam gains some physical aspect of that demon's appearance related to the features granted by it. The amalgam's default appearance for features not granted by another demon is that of a muscular, Large-sized humanoid with red, scaly skin.

Magic Resistance. The amalgam has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The demon makes up to four weapon attacks, using Bite no more than once, and all other available weapon attacks no more than twice each.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) piercing damage, and 9 (2d8) poison damage.
Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

Disclaimer: be aware, this was an experiment. There was zero playtesting that went into this, the CR adjustments are suspect at best, and due to all the different powers from so many different places, this thing would be a nightmare to set up for as a DM (and just forget about running one of these on-the-fly). Having said that, the concept of a semi-randomized monster seems neat to me, and I'd like to eventually get a less logistically-unruly version of this concept into one of my games someday.

Clumsy. The penguin is not as graceful on land as it is in the water. When on standing on solid ground, the penguin has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and any throws against an effect that would knock it prone.
Swimming Leap. If the penguin spends at least 20' of its movement swimming in a straight line, it may immediately end this movement and perform a long jump up to a distance of 25' in the same direction as its last 20' of swimming. This jump is high enough for the penguin to exit the water completely, and may be used to jump out of the water and onto ground. The penguin is assumed to have passed any athletics check that would normally be required for this jump.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The penguin makes two melee attacks.
Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 5', one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the penguin may make a grapple check. If the penguin has a creature grappled, it may not use Beak on any other creature.
Fling. If the penguin has a creature grappled, it may fling that creature as an action. The penguin makes an Athletics check and the result is the distance in feet that the target is thrown. If the creature lands on solid ground, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10' it traveled from the throw, in addition to any fall damage it incurs from dropping in height.

Any creature who encounters the owl within sight of its lair must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, at disadvantage if the owl and its lair are both within sight. A creature who succeeds on any of these saving throws is not frightened, and is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Mock Breath Weapon. Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range (10'/30'), one creature. Hit: The creature gets water squirted in its eyes, if it has any, and if it is not underwater. A creature with water in its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks that rely on sight, attacks against the creature have advantage, and the creature is annoyed. A creature with water in its eyes can wipe them clear as a bonus action.

Ambush Drop. Drop bears favor ambush attacks which they make by dropping from height onto their prey with unerring precision. While hanging above a target creature, the drop bear may release and drop onto the target, moving up to 5' horizontally for every 10' vertically it drops.
  The drop bear makes an Acrobatics check compared to the target's AC (with advantage if the target is unaware) to hit. The drop bear rolls for any applicable fall damage, but on a hit, this damage is halved and applied to both the drop bear and its target, the target is grappled, and the drop bear makes a Claw or Bite attack against the target with advantage. The drop bear may use the Acrobatics check it rolled for this ability to attempt to reduce any applicable fall damage.

Channel Divinity (2/Long Rest).
Turn Undead: As an action, Esfinge presents her holy symbol and speaks a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear her within 30' of her must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is destroyed if its challenge rating is less than or equal to two, otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from Esfinge as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of her. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Touch of Death: Esfinge can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch. When she hits a creature with a melee attack, she can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The extra damage is equal to 29 (5 + 2x cleric level).
Divine Intervention. As an action, Esfinge may petition the Raven Queen for divine intervention. Roll a d%, and if the result is less than or equal to her cleric level, her deity intervenes (as the DM sees fit; targeted effect from a cleric spell is appropriate). After an intervention occurs, this ability cannot be used again for 7 days.
Divine Strike (1/Turn). When Esfinge hits with a weapon attack, the attack deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage.
Inescapable Destruction. Esfinge's cleric spells, cantrips, and channel divinity abilities ignore necrotic damage resistance.
Reaper. When Esfinge uses the chill touch cantrip, she can target two creatures instead of one, as long as both are in range and within 5' of each other.
Spellcasting. Esfinge is a 12th-level Cleric (Death Domain). Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following cantrips, and may prepare 16 cleric spells per day, in addition to those included in her domain spell list:
Cantrips (at-will): Light, Resistance, Sacred Flame, Spare the Dying, Thaumaturgy, Chill Touch
Domain Spell List: false life, ray of sickness, blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement, animate dead, vampiric touch, blight, death ward, antilife shell, cloudkill
War Caster. Esfinge has practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant her several benefits.
  Esfinge has advantage on Constitution saving throws that she makes to maintain her concentration on a spell when she takes damage. Additionally, she can perform the somatic components of spells even when she has weapons or a shield in one or both hands. Finally, when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from her, Esfinge can use her reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.

Iron Will. The executor has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed, or put to sleep.
Telepathy. An executor wearing its mask can telepathically communicate with any other Executor on the same plane of existence.
Undying. An executor that is reduceed to 0 hit points or fewer that is not killed outright is knocked unconscious. At the end of each of the Executor's turns, it may make death saving throws as a player character would, though it is unaffected by failures, and on a result of 19 or 20, it regains 7 (1d8 + 3) hit points and becomes conscious. At the start of such an unconscious Executor's turn, if it has been dealt an amount of damage equal to its hit point maximum since the end of its last turn, it is killed. If an Executor's mask is removed after it has sustained at least 3 death saving throw failures since its last long rest, it dies instantly.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The executor makes two attacks with its longsword, and uses chill touch.
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 5', one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage.

Languages Marmoset; knows Sylvan, but can only speak it telepathically to a creature affected by its Fey Bond.
Challenge 1 (200 XP)

Fey Bond (Recharge 5-6). As an action, the marmoset attempts to tap into and commandeer the mind of a creature it is touching that is not a construct. The marmoset makes a Charisma check contested by a Wisdom check made by the target. If the target succeeds, this ability has no effect. If the marmoset succeeds, it grabs onto the target, the target is charmed, and the marmoset can use the target's movement and actions as its own, acting on the target's turn.
  For as long as this effect continues, the target remains grabbed, and the marmoset cannot grab or use Fey Bond against another creature. If physical contact between the marmoset and the target is broken, this effect ends immediately. If the target is Small size or larger, the target can move normally, and the marmoset moves with it. The target can repeat the contest at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
Standing Leap. The marmoset's long jump is up to 10' and its high jump is up to 5', with or without a running start.
Tiny Acrobat. When the marmoset is falling from a height of 10' or greater, it can use either a reaction or bonus action to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, reducing any fall damage it would normally take by an amount equal to the result of its check. If the damage is reduced to 0, the marmoset lands on its feet.

The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or become grabbed. For as long as the grab lasts, the marmoset cannot gab another creature, and if the target is Small size or larger, it can move normally and the marmoset moves with it.

Familiar. The cubeling can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the cubeling senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. At any time and for any reason, the cubeling can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
Ooze Cube. The cubeling takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a Tiny creature that does so is subjected to the cubeling's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cubeling can be seen but have total cover.
  A creature within 5 feet of the cubeling can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cubeling. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 3 (1d6) acid damage. The cubeling can hold only one Tiny creature inside it at a time.
Transparent. Even when the cubeling is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cubeling that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the it is surprised by the cubeling.

--Actions--
Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) acid damage.
Engulf. The cubeling moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter a Tiny creature's space. Whenever the cubeling enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
  On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 2' back or to the side of the cubeling. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.
  On a failed save, the cubeling enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 3 (1d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cubeling's turns. When the cubeling moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5' of the cubeling.

Maneuvering Attack. When Sarge hits with a weapon attack, he expends 1 superiority die and adds the result to the attack's damage roll. He chooses a friendly creature who can see or hear him who can use their reaction to move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of the initial attack.
Precision Attack. Sarge makes a weapon attack and expends 1 superiority die, adding the result to the attack roll. This maneuver can be used after making an attack roll, but before learning the result.
Pushing Attack. When Sarge hits with a weapon attack, he expends 1 superiority die and adds the result to the attack's damage roll. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or be pushed up to 15’.
Rally. On his turn, Sarge uses a bonus action and expends one superiority die, and a friendly creature who can see or hear him gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + 3.
Crossbow Expert. Sarge ignores the ‘loading’ property for crossbows, does not suffer disadvantage for using ranged weapons within 5’ of a hostile creature, and may fire a loaded hand crossbow as a bonus action when he makes an attack with a one handed weapon in the other hand.
Fighting Style: Archery. Sarge gets a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons (included in attack).
Indomitable (1/Long Rest). If Sarge fails a saving throw, he may re-roll it and use the second result.

Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5’ or range 20’/60’, one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

Note: For the most part, this is a fully legal character sheet for a 12th-level fighter. I added a couple extra languages, as well as immunity to fear, but it's otherwise completely usable. However, if you are a player planning to use this character, make sure to add the 'Student of War' and 'Know Your Enemy' features from the Battle Master archetype. I omitted them here because they don't fit particularly well for an NPC stat block as I've styled it.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 5', one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. The chameleon has advantage on bite attacks against creatures who are grappled as a result of its Tongue attack, and may not use Bite against any other creatures until the grapple ends.
Tongue. One Medium or smaller creature within 25' of the chameleon must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, become grappled, and be pulled 25' straight toward the chameleon.

Amphibious. The snail can breathe both air and water.
Shell. The snail's shell is extremely solid and durable, and provides a relatively safe shelter if it is in danger. As an action, the snail can withdraw into or extend out of its shell. While in its shell, the snail may take no actions except to extend out of its shell, its movement speeds all become 0', it is blinded, and it gains Damage Threshold 20 (any attack that hits it deals no damage unless that damage is 20 or greater) while not prone.
Soft Underbelly. While prone, any attack that hits the snail is a critical hit.
Rock Steady. The snail has advantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would move it or knock it prone. Additionally, if the snail fails a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that would move it or knock it prone, it may make a Strength saving throw, and not be moved or knocked prone on a success, though it still suffers any other effects caused by the triggering failure.

--Actions--
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the snail can't bite another target.
Venomous Barb. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15', one target. Hit:17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 constitution saving throw or take 13 (2d12) poison damage, and become paralyzed for 1 hour.
Swallow. The snail makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the snail, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the snail's turns.
  If the snail takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the snail must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the snail. If the snail dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Flying Finesse. The crane is able to effortlessly fly through light obstructions and avoid larger obstacles found in forest cover such that it has no difficulty flying under or through forest canopy. The crane may squeeze into or through smaller spaces while flying as if it were walking, provided it does not end its movement while squeezing in midair.
Keen Sight and Smell. The crane has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The crane makes two attacks with its beak.
Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 15', one target. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). This attack is made with advantage against a creature the crane is grappling.
 
Solitary and (usually) docile creatures, giant forest cranes make their nests in the higher boughs of the Deepwood. They are known for their remarkable ability to fly under and through the canopy of the colossal woods with impressive speed. Though they spook easily, they are not unwilling to accept food or protection in exchange for providing aid to travelers -- usually by lifting or carrying passengers or cargo in their massive beaks, owing to their long, muscular necks.

Spider Climb. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Web Net. Over the course of 1 minute, the spider can fashion a net out of its own web. This net functions the same as a standard net made of rope, except that its AC and escape DC are each 13 instead of 10.
Web Sense. While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
Web Walker. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing

--Actions--
Multiattack. The spider makes two bite attacks, or one attack with its net and one with its bite.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
Web Net. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10', one target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 13) and restrained as if by a net (AC 13, escape DC 13).

Delicate Wings. If the moth takes 10 or more fire or slashing damage from a single attack, it suffers damage to its wings and its fly speed is reduced by 10'. If it sustains such damage a second time before completing a long rest, its wings are ruined and its fly speed becomes 0'.
Keen Smell. The moth has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.
Light Attraction. Like its smaller relatives, the moth is attracted to various light sources. When in areas of mostly dim light or darkness, the moth is drawn toward the nearest source of bright light it can see, if not actively engaged in a more urgent activity (such as combat).

--Actions--
Raking Grasp. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage, and if the target is Large size or smaller, the target becomes grappled (escape DC 13). The moth may fly with a grappled target of Small size or smaller with no movement penalty.
Wing Attack. The moth beats its massive wings. Each creature in a 15' cone in front of the moth must pass a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, be pushed 5', and knocked prone. The moth may not use this action if its wings have been ruined.

Variant: Giant War Moth.
Giant moths are sometimes used as flying mounts by some races, usually being equipped with specially-made barding to increase its AC. When riding on the moth's back, a creature of Medium size or smaller can be carried with no movement penalty.

Salt Weakness. A handful of salt thrown onto the snail's slimy skin deals 10 (4d4) acid damage to it. Damage dealt from larger amounts of salt are determined by the DM. If the snail is completely covered in salt, it shrivels and dies at the end of its next turn if it is not washed away.
Shell. The snail's shell is extremely solid and durable, and provides a relatively safe shelter if it is in danger. As an action, the snail can withdraw into or extend out of its shell. While in its shell, the snail may take no actions except to extend out of its shell, its movement speed becomes 0', it automatically fails any Dexterity saving throws, it is blinded, and it gains Damage Threshold 10 (any attack that hits it deals no damage unless that damage is 10 or greater) while not prone.
Slime. The snail leaves a 5' wide line of slime in its trail which lasts for 24 hours. A creature that steps on the slime must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or slip and fall prone in the slime. A creature who falls prone in snail slime is restrained (escape DC 13).
Soft Underbelly. While prone, any attack that hits the snail is a critical hit.
Rock Steady. The snail has advantage on Strength saving throws made against effects that would move it or knock it prone. Additionally, if the snail fails a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that would move it or knock it prone, it may make a Strength saving throw, negating the forced movement or prone effect on a success, though it still suffers any other effects caused by the triggering failure.

--Actions--
Swallow. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). If the target is still grappled at the start of the snail's next turn, it is swallowed and the grapple ends. The snail cannot swallow a creature while it has another living creature swallowed.
  While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the snail, and it takes 10 (4d4) acid damage at the start of each of the snail's turns.
  If the snail takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the snail must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5' of the snail. If the snail dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Endless Breath. The turtle does not need to breathe.
Hollow. Inside the turtle's shell is an empty cavity large enough to fit four Medium-sized creatures (6 if squeezing), or one Large-sized creature (plus 2 Medium-sized creatures, if squeezing). The turtle's mouth opens wide enough for a Large-sized creature to squeeze through, and when shut creates a water-tight seal. When sealed, the turtle's cavity provides a total of 120 minutes of air, divided among all breathing creatures inside. After this time period has expired, all breathing creatures inside begin to suffocate.
Telepathic Direction. While any number of creatures are inside its shell, the turtle possesses no discernible will of its own. Any creature inside the turtle's shell may use an action to make a DC 13 Intelligence check to form a telepathic link with the turtle, concentrating to maintain this link until their concentration is broken, or until they choose to end it as a free action. While this link is formed, the creature sees through the turtle's eyes, and can use its actions to have the turtle take its own actions instead.
  While the turtle is being controlled by a creature, another creature within the turtle may use its action to initiate an Intelligence Contest to wrest control of the turtle for itself, the winner of the contest becoming the sole controller of the turtle. Any contest result of less than 13 automatically fails, and if both contestants roll lower than 13, then they both lose control. While not being actively controlled, the turtle continues travelling in a straight line in the direction it was headed when last controlled, or remains stationary if it was not moving.

--Actions--
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the turtle is submerged up to its mouth, this attack causes its shell cavity to fill up 1/4 of the way with water. Any accumulated water in its cavity empties over the course of 1 round if it opens its mouth while not in water.
Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the turtle moves at least 10' in a straight line immediately before making this attack, it deals an extra 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage, and each creature within the turtle's shell cavity must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

Ambulatory Tomb (Recharge 5-6). The Grave Giant shows a unique, yet sickeningly macabre instinct, which is to hollow out its own chest cavity, then wander around graveyards or battlefields, collecting humanoid corpses to stuff inside of itself to carry around. This behavior makes them valuable assets to necromancers who can control them, as over time, the unholy energy that possesses the giant reanimates the corpses within it, causing them to stir into action in times of battle.
  When in combat, if this trait is recharged at the start of the giant's turn, 1 (1d4 - 1) CR ¼ Zombie creature crawls out of the giant's open chest cavity and lands prone in a space within 5' of the giant. These zombies are for all intents and purposes wholly separate creatures, and their initiative order immediate follows the giant's.
Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the giant to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + any left over damage, unless that damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
Undeath Spawn. Immediately after the giant is killed, 3 (2d4 - 2) Zombies emerge from the corpse, and appear within the giant's space. These zombies are the same as those from the Ambulatory Tomb trait.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The giant makes two Scimitar attacks, or a Scimitar attack and a Rotting Fist attack.
Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10', one target.Hit: 21 (4d6 + 7) slashing damage.
Rotting Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage.

Half-Ooze, Half-Beast. While motionless, a half-ooze is indistinguishable from one of any Large-sized beast it chooses to mimic. Once it moves or attacks, however, its fundamental wrongness becomes apparent, as it lumbers about, its limbs flailing around and its joints bending in ways that shouldn't be possible.
   While the half-ooze is solid, and has an external texture as expected from the beast it mimics, it is composed entirely of an undulating gelatin-like material which when cut, exudes a viscous, acidic liquid very similar to the composition of its more traditional ooze relatives. This ooze-like ichor seals and mends cuts and other wounds made throughout its body, pitting nonmagical weapons used against it, and granting it resistance to slashing damage.
Corrosive Form. A creature that touches a wounded half-ooze, or is within 5 feet of it when it takes slashing damage takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that deals piercing or slashing to the half-ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the half-ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.
Shapechanger. The half-ooze can use its action to polymorph into a Large beast or monstrosity which it has seen before, or into a form similar to that of a Gelatinous Cube. Its statistics and size are the same in each form. If the creature it polymorphs into lacks teeth or claws, it loses the ability to use the corresponding attack action. Any objects or equipment it is carrying aren’t transformed. It reverts to a shallow mound or puddle of slime when it dies.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The half-ooze makes one Bite and one Claw attack, or two Claw attacks.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and 13 (3d8) acid damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 15', one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and 9 (2d8) acid damage.

Earthmelter (Recharge 4-6). The Earthmelter projects a line of intense heat 30' long and 15' wide out from its wielder. Creatures within the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 28 (8d6) fire damage and is lit on fire. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not lit on fire. A creature that is on fire takes an 14 (4d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns until it spends an action to put itself out.
  This weapon is able to melt solid stone or dirt if aimed roughly perpendicular to its surface at a range of 15' or less. Doing this causes the material to become molten, causing 4d6 fire damage to any creature that touches it, and if the surface is 5 or fewer feet thick, a 5' diameter cylinder is melted through it, creating a passageway once the stone has cooled over the course of 10 minutes.

Innate Spellcasting. The hopeless' spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: animal friendship, beast bond, minor illusion, thaumaturgy
2/rest each: blindness/deafness, moonbeam, ray of enfeeblement
1/day each: alter self, blur, suggestion
Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the hopeless has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The hopeless makes two weapon attacks.
Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5' or range (20'/60'), one target.Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.
Shadow Step. As an action while in dim light or darkness, the hopeless teleports to a space it can see within 60' of it which is also in dim light or darkness.
Creeping Darkness (Recharge 5-6). One creature the hopeless can see within 60' of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and have its vision clouded. A creature whose vision is clouded takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, perceives areas with bright light as if they had only dim light, areas with dim light as if they were complete darkness, and loses the benefits of darkvision if it has it. An affected creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending these effects on a success.

Adrenal Glands. If the hormagaunt uses the Dash action on its turn and moves at least 20' straight towards a creature, ending its movement within reach of that creature, the hormagaunt may make two scything talon attacks with advantage against that creature as part of the Dash action.
Extra Limbs. If the hormagaunt has not moved this turn, it may spend all of its movement this round to make two scything talon attacks against a target within reach as a bonus action.
Fleet of Claw. When the hormagaunt uses the Dash action, its movement speed increases by 10' for the purpose of that Dash.
Hive Mind. If at the start of its turn, the hormagaunt is within its telepathy range of an allied tyranid creature with the Synapse trait, the hormagaunt is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions and gains advantage on any Wisdom saving throws until the start of its next turn. Otherwise, the hormagaunt reverts to its animal instincts: roll 1d3 and compare the result to the Instinctive Behavior options below to determine how the hormagaunt acts this turn.
1: Lurk. The hormagaunt uses all available movement to seek the nearest available cover and position itself behind it, using its action to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to Hide once there. If no cover is visible within the hormagaunts movement range, it drops prone and takes the Dodge action.
2: Flee. The hormagaunt uses all available movement to run towards the nearest Tyranid creature it can see that has the Synapse trait. If none are visible from the hormagaunt's position, it uses all of its movement to move away from any and all hostile creatures. It uses no actions except to Dash, or to remove any objects or creatures preventing it from fleeing.
3: Hunt. The hormagaunt uses its movement to move within reach of the nearest hostile creature it can see and uses its action to attack it. If the hormagaunt is not within its movement range of a hostile creature, it may use Dash to move towards such a creature more quickly. If the hormagaunt cannot see any hostile creatures, it will wander aimlessly, and make Wisdom (Perception) checks to try and detect the presence of any non-Tyranid creatures to attack.

Multiattack. The hormagaunt makes two attacks with its scything talons.

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks that rely on sight.

--Actions--
Gravetouch Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5', one creature. Hit: The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) cold damage and 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. The creature then must succeed on a second DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by the necrotic damage dealt by this attack. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a Long Rest. A creature dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
Piercing Stare One creature who can see the wraith must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become Stunned and unable break eye contact until the end of the wraith's next turn. This effect ends if the eye contact between the creature and the wraith is broken. If at the start of the wraith's turn a creature is already under the effect of this ability, the wraith may use this ability against that same creature as a bonus action. No two creatures may be under the effect of this ability from the same wraith simultaneously.

Hold Breath. The Hydra can hold its breath for up to 1 hour.
Multiple Heads. The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.
Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.
At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown this way.
Reactive Heads. For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
Wakeful. While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.
Treasure Sense. The hydra can pinpoint, by smell, the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 120' of it.
Placated with Tribute. This particular hydra has a lust for gold that rivals that of full-grown dragons. It becomes restless after spending too long without acquiring new gold for its hoard. Recognizing this, local pirates have come to a mutually-beneficial relationship with the hydra, giving it tribute in the form of gold -- a portion of their booty from raided ships -- which they pay by dropping the gold overboard when travelling past its lair.
Authorities and bounty hunters seeking the pirates who are unaware of this creature's presence, will usually pass by without paying such tribute, and thus end up face-to-face-to-face-to-face with a very annoyed hydra.

Multiattack. The hydra makes as many Bite attacks as it has heads.

Lucky (3/Day). When making an attack roll or saving throw, the fish may roll a second time and keep either result.
Hollow. Inside the fish is an empty cavity large enough to fit two medium-sized creatures. The fish's mouth opens wide enough for a medium-sized creature to squeeze through, and when shut creates a water-tight seal.
Innate Restoration. Any creature who spends a Long Rest within the fish is cured of any diseases and any blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned condition(s) currently affecting it.

--Actions--
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. Any creatures inside the fish must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone and take 1 (1d4 - 1) bludgeoning damage.
If the fish travels at least 10' in a straight line toward the target immediately before making this attack, it instead deals 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and creatures inside instead take 2 (1d6 - 1) bludgeoning damage and fall prone on a failed save.

Bio-luminescence. Jellyfolk possess lights within their translucent body which they can illuminate or extinguish at will. While illuminated, the jellyfolk may choose to have these lights cast either bright light out to 15' and dim light for another 15' beyond that radius, or just dim light out to 5'.
Fey Resistance. The jellyfolk has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the jellyfolk to sleep.

Keen Smell. The wasp has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
Organic Carpentry. The wasp regurgitates a sticky paste made from a mixture of saliva and wood fiber which dries to form a rough, surprisingly-resilient, parchment-like substance. This substance is used to build the long, labyrinthine tunnels in which the wasps make their colonies, as well as to affix prey and other food in place for future feeding.

If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

Kleptomaniac. Little thieves can't resist tiny metal objects. Things like thimbles, coins, screws, sewing needles and the like are absolutely irresistible to their kind. Regardless of their current plans, if a thief happens across such an object, it will immediately begin devising and executing a plan to steal that item in such a way so as to avoid being caught doing so.
  If a thief comes across an item it decides it must steal (as determined by the DM), but realizes that doing so would most likely bring about harmful consequences, the thief must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to steal that item, regardless of the risk. The thief may repeat this saving throw if it is discovered to be up to such thievery, and/or whenever it takes damage while attempting to do so, ending this compulsion on a success.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The thief makes two attacks with its fists.
Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 1 (1d4 - 1) bludgeoning damage.
Reconfigure. The thief reconfigures its physical structure to resemble a flask, a kettle, or some other small metal object; or simply to the smallest possible form factor it can manage. While in this reconfigured state, the thief has a speed of 0', has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide, and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find it have disadvantage. The thief can end this state as a bonus action.

Magnetic. The cube is composed of a tough, almost rubbery ooze which is opaque with a heavy, almost metallic dust. The cube's entire body possesses a considerable magnetic pull, so much so that any creature that hits or misses the cube with a melee weapon attack using a weapon made with any type of iron or steel must then succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or lose grip of their weapon as it disappears into the cube's body.
  Additionally, any creature wearing armor made primarily of any type of iron or steel has disadvantage on saving throws made to escape the cube's Engulf attack, and any ability checks made to extricate such an engulfed creature also have disadvantage.
Ooze Cube. The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.
  Creatures inside the cube have total cover, and any movement beneath the cube's surface is apparent from outside of it.
  A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 14 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) acid damage. The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

--Actions--
Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) acid damage.
Engulf. The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.
  On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5' back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.
  On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage and 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.
  An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5' of the cube.

Spellcasting. The mage is an 8th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): Friends, Mage Hand, Mending, Mold Earth

Stone Stacks. In and around the mage's home, he has constructed a number of pillars consisting of loose-stacked stones, each about 7'-8' tall and 3'-4' in diameter. Each of these pillars resonates with the mage's power, and amplifies his magical abilities. Each pillar takes about an hour to construct and requires an abundance of stones of various shapes and sizes. Each pillar can be toppled by simply shoving it over as an action.
  At the beginning of each of the mage's turns, he regains 1 hit point for each intact pillar within 30' of him. Additionally, any spell he casts that would do damage deals an additional 1 point of lightning damage for each pillar within 30' of him when the spell was cast.

Pillar Barrage (Recharge 5-6). As a bonus action, the mage points at one creature he can see, and each pillar within 30' of the target fires a single Magic Missile at that creature.
Pillar Overload. The mage chooses one pillar he can see and causes it to erupt in an arcane explosion. The pillar is destroyed, and each creature within 15' of it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) force damage, and 9 (2d8) lightning damage, or half as much on a success.

Forest Strider. When moving at half of its speed or less, the elk makes no detectable sound whatsoever. Additionally, the elk is so coated with moss and canopy debris, it is surprisingly easy for it to blend in with the forest. When in dim light or darkness within a forest environment, the elk can use the Hide action, even from creatures who have line of sight to it. In such environments, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find it have disadvantage. This does not hide the elk from creatures with darkvision if it is within their darkvision range.

Magic Resistance. The mind beacon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Psionic Manifestations. The mind beacon has a wealth of psionic energy which it draws from to manifest psionic abilities, as well as to augment its attacks with psionic power. This psionic energy is represented as a pool of psionic 'Power Points' which has a maximum of 20 and which fully replenishes at the end of each long rest. The mind beacon may spend points from this pool to augment its attack actions as shown in the action's description, or as a bonus action to manifest one of the following psionic abilities:
Invigorate (3 points). The Mind Beacon gains 5 temporary hit points.
Mind Thrust (3 points). One target creature the mind beacon can see must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 13 (2d12) psychic damage.
Brilliant Radiance (2 point). Any creature who can see the mind beacon must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn.
Telekinesis (2 points). The mind beacon telekinetically moves a creature or object weighing up to 100lbs as if by theTelekinesis spell (using Intelligence as spellcasting modifier). Each subsequent turn this ability is maintained costs an additional 1 point.
Blurred Step (1 point). The mind beacon teleports up to 15' to an unoccupied space it can see.
Influence Environment (1 point). The mind beacon influences the area around it. Within a radius of 60', the mind beacon creates or ceases a mild wind, ignites or extinguishes any torches or candles, increases or decreases the ambient light level, or manifests a phantom sound.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The mind beacon makes three Skewer attacks.
Skewer. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit:6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage.
Radiant Beam (Recharge 4-6). Each creature in a line 25' long and 5' wide originating from the mind beacon must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) radiant damage.
Augment: 2 points - the damage dealt by this attack on a hit is increased to 22 (4d10) radiant damage.
Augment: 1 point - the type of damage dealt by this attack is changed to the mind beacon's choice of fire, lightning, cold, or necrotic.
Concussive Blast (Recharge 4-6). Each creature within 10' of the mind beacon must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) force damage, is pushed 5', and is knocked prone. On a success, the target takes half as much force damage, and is not pushed or knocked prone.
Augment: 3 points - instead of radiating in all directions, the attack is focused into a 20' cone out from the mind beacon, the push distance is increased to 10', and the force damage dealt on a failed saving throw is increased to 14 (4d6).
Augment: 1 point - the distance a creature is pushed on a failed saving throw is increased by 5'.

I picture this thing as a giant metallic tick or mite or spider or something with a great, big, crystal for an abdomen which is the source of all of its psionics.

Groupmind. Each constituent rat within the swarm can communicate telepathically with every other, and their collective consciousness is strong enough to even transfer thoughts to and from similar nearby creatures. At the start of each of its turns, the swarm is aware of any hostile creatures identified by any undead or rats within 100' of it.
  Additionally, at the end of each of the swarm's turns during which it made an attack, any rats or undead creatures within 100' of the swarm must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw (a creature that is both undead and a rat fails automatically). A creature that fails this saving throw must choose a target that the swarm attacked this turn, and on its next turn, move towards that creature by the fastest route available, and must use any actions available to attack that creature.
Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny rat. The swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The swarm makes 2d4 Bite attacks, distributed among any number of creatures within 5' of it.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage. If this attack is a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 5 (2d4) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.

Air Form. The elemental can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Life From Music. The elemental, while composed of air, is woven from and driven by music. The elemental can only be conjured through a specific ritual which involves playing a song of the caster's choice. Once conjured, the elemental draws power from any music audible from its present location, and even absorbs some of the music's properties.
  At the start of each of the elemental's turns, it regains 10 hit points if there is music audible from its space. If there is no such music, it suffers 11 (2d10) psychic damage instead. The elemental also, at the start of its turn, attunes itself to a single source of music it can hear. If the elemental can hear multiple music sources, it attunes itself to that which is most dominant. If two or more sources are competing, they may make a Charisma contest to determine the dominant one, otherwise the loudest is dominant.
  The elemental serves the intention of whichever source of music it is currently attuned to. If such a source is not a creature, the creator of that source imbues it with his or her own intention at the time of its creation. Furthermore, the elemental gains certain properties from the music it is currently attuned to. If the volume of the music is sufficiently quiet or loud (as determined by the DM), the elemental shrinks or grows as if affected accordingly by the Enlarge/Reduce spell. Furthermore, the elemental's movement speeds and regular complement of actions are affected by the music's tempo:

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
Deafening Blast. Any creature in a 20' cone in front of the elemental must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (1d10 + 4) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.
Shockwave. As a bonus action, the elemental releases a sudden, forceful blast of air in all directions. Any creature within 5' of the elemental must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5' and knocked prone.
Transposition. As either a bonus action or a reaction, the elemental may teleport 10' to an unoccupied space.

Keen Smell. The tiger has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made using smell.
Luminous. The tiger sheds bright light in a 10' radius and dim light in an additional 10'.
Pounce. If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the tiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action

Magic Resistance. Nereus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Water Form. Nereus can enter any other creature’s space and stop there (creatures move through Nereus' space as if they were swimming). Nereus can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. If he ends his movement outside of a body of water at least as large as his space, or if he is forced to move as such, Nereus begins to flow helplessly with gravity. While flowing in this way, at the beginning of each of his turns, he must use all of his movement to move downward, following the slope of whatever surface he is currently on until he reaches either a body of water, or a basin-like ground formation large enough to contain him. He may use actions at any point during this movement, except actions that would require or cause him to move against this flow.
Freeze. If Nereus takes at least 25 cold damage on a single turn, he partially freezes; each of his movement speeds are reduced by half until the end of his next turn.
Innate Spellcasting. While in a body of water at least 10 miles across, Nereus can innately cast the control water, control winds, andcontrol weather spells using Wisdom as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17) and requiring no components.

--Actions--
Multiattack. Nereus makes 3 crash attacks.
Crash. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10', one target. Hit:27 (3d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
Whelm (Recharge 5-6). Each creature in Nereus' space must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If it is Huge or smaller, it is also grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half damage and is pushed out of Nereus' space.
  Nereus can grapple one Huge creature or up to three Large or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of Nereus' turns, each target grappled by it takes 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. A creature that is not within Nereus' space that can reach another creature within his space can pull that creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check and succeeding.
Water Meld. Nereus melds into or coalesces from a body of water at least twice his size that he is currently in. While melded, he is invisible and cannot take bonus actions or reactions. He also cannot take actions except to use Water Meld again to end this state.

--Legendary Actions--
Nereus can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Nereus regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
Detect. Nereus makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
Surge. Nereus moves up to half his speed.
Tempest (Costs 2 Actions). Nereus casts either control water orcontrol wind.

--Actions--
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +0 to hit, range 5', one creature. Hit 1 piercing damage.
Nerve Tap. One living creature the leech is touching must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be pierced by the leech's needle-like sting, which releases a web of branching tendrils under the target's skin. Once pierced, the leech is grappled onto the target, and if the target moves, the leech moves with it. The leech can only be removed either by killing it, or pulling it off the grappled creature. Pulling the leech off requires a DC 13 Strength check, which causes the pierced target to take 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a success, and half as much on a failure, in addition to the leech remaining attached.
  At the start of each of the leech's turns, the grappled target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or the leech's tendrils reach further across the target's body, at a rate determined by the DM. Any portion of the target's body that has been completely compromised by the leech's tendrils falls under the control of the leech.
  If the leech's tendrils reach the target's brain, the leech gains control of the target's entire body. At this point, the leech cannot be removed without killing the host, except by magical means. Once the leech assumes full control of a host, it still takes time to acclimate to its new body, and has a -2 penalty to all ability modifiers (to a minimum of -5), which improves by 1 for each long rest the leech spends in its host, until the penalty disappears.

+3 Stave of the Wood. Nicolas carries the magical Stave of the Wood, which serves both as a melee weapon and spellcasting implement. The stave has a +3 enhancement bonus which is added to melee and spell attack rolls and damage rolls (included in actions).
  Additionally, the stave allows him to, as an action, force any plant creature within line of sight from him to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature may not target Nicolas with any attack or harmful spell until the end of its next turn, at which point it repeats the saving throw. A second failure causes the creature to be compelled to obey all commands issued by Nicolas for 24 hours (or until he uses this ability again) if the creature's current hit point total is less than Niocolas's hit point maximum.
  A success on any of these saving throws ends the effects. Once used, this ability cannot be activated again until Nicolas completes a short or long rest.

Luminous. The snail projects dim light of a color matching its skin out to a range of 5 feet.
Prismatic Attunement. Every snail is keenly attuned to a specific type of magic connected to The Weave, represented by the color of the snail and the remarkable environmental effects it projects. This connection causes the snail to project a field out from itself 30' in every direction. Within this area, the behavior of certain types of magic can be altered, and environmental effects related to that type of magic manifest spontaneously (such as noticeable heat, cold, or fumes). The snail's type is determined randomly from the table below (or chosen by the DM):
d6
Color
Field Effects
1
Red
Fire damage is doubled to creatures in the area. Cancels out the effects from a blue snail where their fields overlap.
2
Orange
Liquids exposed to the air become acidic: any liquid not touching a creature becomes acid and deals 1d6 acid damage on contact.
3
Yellow
Conductive objects and surfaces in the area not carried or worn by a creature become electrically charged, and deal 1d10 lightning damage to the first creature that touches them -- double if the creature is wearing armor made primarily of metal -- and subsequently becoming inert for 1 hour.
4
Green
The air in the area becomes toxic. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute.
5
Blue
Liquids not currently in contact with a creature freeze in a matter of seconds: if a liquid is poured or spilled within the area, it freezes solid after 1 round. Cancels out the effects from a red snail where their fields overlap.
6
Violet
The division between planes becomes distorted here. Any creature that starts its turn within the area must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become blinded until it starts its turn outside of the area. If a creature starts its turn within the area, and is already blinded by this effect, it must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be transported to a random plane of existence, or to its home plane if it is not currently there. A creature transported to a random plane remains blind, but may repeat its Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a success, and returning to the closest unoccupied space to where it departed from 1d4 rounds after saving from the effect.
 

 
A Prismatic Snail is a tiny, effectively helpless creature which possesses no attack capability. It moves so slowly that it appears to be stationary, though over the course of a day or so, it could feasibly travel the span of a small room. It absorbs sustenance directly from The Weave, the imperceptible field of energy from which magic spells get their power. As such, they are often found in the greatest numbers in areas where The Weave's influence is strongest.
  They are granted a color and magical properties depending on the type of magic they are most closely attuned to. This type is determined at birth, but if a snail is starving due to the lack of energy to be absorbed of that snail's type in its environment, it can gradually shift its attunement to that of a different, more beneficial type.

Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny ripper. The swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
Hive Mind. If at the start of its turn, the swarm is within its telepathy range of an allied tyranid creature with the Synapse trait, the swarm is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions and gains advantage on any Wisdom saving throws until the start of its next turn. Otherwise, the swarm reverts to its animal instincts: roll 1d3 and compare the result to the Instinctive Behavior options below to determine how the swarm acts this turn.
1: Lurk. The swarm uses all available movement to seek the nearest available cover and position itself behind it, using its action to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to Hide once there. If no cover is visible within the swarm's movement range, it drops prone and takes the Dodge action.
2: Flee. The swarm uses all available movement to run towards the nearest Tyranid creature it can see that has the Synapse trait. If none are visible from the swarm's position, it uses all of its movement to move away from any and all hostile creatures. It uses no actions except to Dash, or to remove any objects or creatures preventing it from fleeing.
3: Hunt. The swarm uses its movement to move within reach of the nearest hostile creature it can see and uses its action to attack it. If the swarm is not within its movement range of a hostile creature, it may use Dash to move towards such a creature more quickly.

Action Surge (1/Short Rest). Rose can take two Actions this turn.
Grappler. Rose has advantage on attack rolls against any creature she is grappling.
Reckless. At the start of her turn, Rose can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against her have advantage until the start of her next turn.
Unarmored Defense. While Rose is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, her AC includes her Constitution modifier.

--Actions--
Multiattack. Rose makes two unarmed strike attacks.
Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5', one creature. Hit:7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Rose can grapple the target (escape DC 14).
Toss. Rose makes a Strength (Athletics) check to toss a grappled creature. The creature is thrown in a direction of Rose's choice up to a number of feet equal to the result of this check. The creature lands prone, and takes an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 for every 10' it travels. If the creature is thrown into a solid surface, it takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage in addition to the amount it takes for the distance it traveled before it collided with the surface.
  If the creature is thrown at another creature, the secondary target creature can make either a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the attack, or a DC 14 Strength saving throw to try and catch the thrown creature. If the secondary target creature fails either of these saving throws, it and the thrown creature each take half of the total damage dealt from the throw. If it succeeds on the Strength saving throw, neither creature takes damage from the throw. If it succeeds on the Dexterity saving throw, the secondary target takes no damage, and the thrown creature takes damage as normal.

Cargo and Crew. The sailbeast is typically about 20' wide, and 30'-40' long. While swimming, it can carry as many creatures and/or objects as can fit on its flat-top surface, of a combined weight up to four times the typical carrying capacity for a creature its size -- a maximum of approximately 12,000 lbs.
Hold Breath. The sailbeast can hold its breath for 15 minutes.
Ramming Speed. If the sailbeast moves at least 20' straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 21 (6d6) damage. If the target is a waterborne vehicle, all occupants must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Sails. The sailbeast possesses an array of large wing-like flaps of leathery skin which it can, as an action, extend or withdraw to use as sails to help propel itself across the seas. While these sails are extended, the sailbeast's swim speed is doubled when moving with the wind, and halved when moving against the wind.

--Actions--
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10', one target. Hit: 33 (4d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is large size or smaller, it is swallowed.
  A swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the sailbeast, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the sailbeast’s turns. If the sailbeast dies, any swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10' of movement, exiting prone.
Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the sailbeast takes bludgeoning damage equal to half the amount dealt to the target.

Deconstructed. Seraph is able to remove his body parts at will, which each act independently even when separated. When detached, these parts keep the same ability scores, AC, and skills as Seraph, except they have a move speed of 15' and gain Blindsight 30'. Each of these parts acts immediately following Seraph's turn, in the order in which they were removed. They can take any actions their forms allow them to, though each may only make an attacks listed below for that part.

--Actions--
Detatch Limb. Seraph removes a body part that has not already been removed (choice of: head, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). Seraph loses 1d8+3 hit points, which the detached part takes as its hit point maximum. If at least one of Seraph's arms is still attached after this removal, he may throw the part up to 30' as part of the same action. As a later action, Seraph may reattach a separated part within 5 feet of him, regaining any remaining hit points that part has.
Seraph's parts (Or Seraph, if he has that part attached) may make the following attack actions on their turn:
Head: Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit:5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.
Arm: Punch. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit:4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Born from Shadow. The spider is invisible when in areas of dim light or darkness, even to creatures with darkvision.
Shadow Walk. As a bonus action, the spider can turn into an incorporeal shadowy mist. In this form it loses all movement speeds and gains a fly (hover) speed of 30'. It also has damage resistance against all types of weapon damage, and it cannot touch or interact with physical objects. The spider may remove this effect as a subsequent bonus action.
Spider Climb. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Web Walker. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

--Actions--
Multiattack The spider uses two bite attacks.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5', one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage and 3 (1d6) poison damage. Bite attacks from the spider that hit against targets unaware of the spider's presence deal an extra 3 (1d6) piercing damage against that target.
Web. One target the spider can see within 30' of it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become tangled in webbing and restrained (escape DC 16). If the target is restrained as a result of this attack, it is attached to the spider by a strand of silk unless the spider chooses to sever it.
Reel. One target attached to the spider as a result of its web attack is pulled 15' directly towards the spider. This including being lifted into the air, if the strand is being pulled upward. The spider cannot use reel if the silk strand is severed.

Innate Spellcasting. The terror can innately cast the darkness spell, requiring no material components.
Shadow Stride. While moving, the terror is amorphous, allowing it to move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Additionally, the terror does not provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures within whose reach it did not begin its turn.
Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the terror can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

Sleep Paralysis (Recharge 6). Up to three target creatures within 60' of the terror that can see it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of their next turn, at which point they repeat the saving throw. If a target fails its subsequent saving throw, it is knocked unconscious for 1 minute, cast into a nightmare-fraught sleep. At the start of each of a target's turns while unconscious, if it has taken damage or has been vigorously shaken since the end of its last turn, it may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
Consume Nightmares. One creature who is currently asleep and experiencing nightmares is touched by the terror and must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 22 (5d8) necrotic damage, the terror regains hit points equal to half of this amount, and the target takes an additional 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns for as long as it remains asleep. On a success, the target takes half as much damage, the terror is not healed, and the target suffers no ongoing damage.

Shrieking. Presumed to be a distant relative of the gibbering mouther, the strider is nearly always preceded by its horrifying shrieking. This screeching sound somehow seems as if it is comprised of a chorus of awful voices all screaming in unison, and the sound grates at the mind and corrodes the will. Each creature that starts its turn within 60' of the creature and can hear its shrieks must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.
  On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its next turn:
1-4: The creature does nothing.
5-6: The creature takes no actions or bonus actions and moves as far as it can in a randomly determined direction.
7-8: The creature makes a melee attack against a random creature within its reach, or does nothing if it can't make such an attack.
Aberrant Aura. The space in a 15' radius around the strider seems to be a bubble in which the laws of time and space begin to break down: solid ground becomes doughy and difficult to traverse, and the trajectories of projectiles seem to curve and bend nonsensically. The area within this radius is difficult terrain, and ranged attack rolls made against targets within this area have disadvantage.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The strider uses two rake attacks.
Rake. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) necrotic damage.
Wail (Recharge 6). Each creature within 60' of the strider that can hear it must succeed on a DC14 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) thunder damage, and become stunned until the end of its next turn.

False Appearance. While the plant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a blooming cactus.
Venomous Needles. Any creature that touches the plant is stuck with its venomous needles and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is unconscious and poisoned for 1 day. Only magical restoration can remove these effects early.

--Actions--
Sing. When a creature is within 30' of the plant, its blooms slowly open and emit a haunting, yet alluring melody which is audible within 300 feet of it. Any creature that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. Whenever a charmed creature takes damage from a source other than the plant, that creature can repeat the saving throw. A charmed creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it, and it is immune to the plant's song for 24 hours.
  A creature charmed by the plant is incapacitated and ignores the songs of any other plants. It is compelled to move its speed each turn toward the plant by the most direct route possible. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but will not move into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, if at all possible. If the creature is within reach of the plant, the creature is compelled to reach out with both hands and tightly grasp the plant's needled exterior. A creature that does this has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw against the plant's Venomous Needles.

Agile Stalker. The wendigo does not suffer penalties to Stealth checks from movement. Additionally, if the wendigo uses the Dash action on its turn, it may then immediately make a Stealth check to hide as bonus action if it ends its movement in a space which has total cover from any non-allied creatures.
Keen Hearing and Sight. The wendigo has advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or sight.
Pounce. If the wendigo moves at least 20' straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the wendigo can make one Claw attack against it as a bonus action.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The wendigo makes three Claw attacks.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the wendigo moves at least 20' during its turn, this attack may be used as a bonus action against a creature within 5' of the wendigo at any point during this movement.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
Hungering Pounce. The spirit moves up to its speed directly towards the largest-sized creature it can see. Once it is within 15' of the target creature, it jumps the remaining distance, and that target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is grappled. The target has disadvantage on its saving throw if it was not aware of the spirit's presence or location.
Gorge on Flesh. If the spirit has moved 10' or less this round, it uses all remaining movement and one creature that is grappled by the spirit must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, and 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.
Etherealness. The spirit enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can’t affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

Any creature that begins its turn within 5' of the treant must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage (creatures who are in physical contact with the treant take a -5 penalty to this saving throw). Additionally, at the beginning of each of its turns, the treant takes 2d6 fire damage.
If the treant is wholly submerged in water for at least one round, the fire within it is quickly quenched, causing the wood to warp and split, killing the treant immediately.

Fire Form. The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 11 (2d10) fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 11 (2d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
Storm Armor (Recharge 5-6). The elemental clads itself in armor made of tempestuous storm clouds which provides it with an AC of 17 and immunity to lightning damage. The elemental can conjure or dismiss this armor as a bonus action. At the start of the elemental's turn, if it has taken 25 or more thunder or force damage since its last turn, the armor dissipates, and the elemental loses all benefits thereof. The elemental may not make Recharge rolls for this ability while the armor is active.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The elemental makes four Storm Sword attacks, or two Storm Sword attacks and one Fire Javelin attack.
Storm Sword. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10', one target. Hit: 16 (2d12 + 3) slashing damage, plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.
Fire Javelin. Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range (40'/160'), one target. Hit: 26 (4d10 + 4) piercing damage, plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and each creature within 5' of the target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.
Typhoon Rush (Recharge 6). The elemental moves up to 30' in a straight line. Any creature that is within 5' of the elemental's space at any point during this movement must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) thunder damage, and 22 (4d10) fire damage. Additionally, any creature in the elemental's space at the end of this movement must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5' and knocked prone.

  The result of a fleeting alliance between air and fire elementals, this abomination is a fierce warrior which knows and desires nothing besides combat. It uses the strengths of both of its creator races to become a nigh-unstoppable force in battle, whipping around at great speed while dealing blow after devastating blow, each imbued with tremendous fire and force.

Bone Talons. The beast has 6-8 long and sharp talons made from bone which when not in combat, are kept folded between its flayed and decaying flesh. As a bonus action, the beast may extend or withdraw these talons, which reach out like long, sharpened, spider-like appendages. While extended, the talons increase the beast's movement speed by 10', and may be used as melee weapons.

Amorphous. The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Corrosive Form. A creature that touches the ooze or hits it with a melee attack while within 5' of it takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Non magical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, non magical wood or metal in 1 round.
Sputtering. The surface of the ooze is constantly fizzing and spitting drops of potent acid in all directions. At the start of each of the ooze's turns, each creature within 5' of the ooze takes 4 (1d8) acid damage.

Silkencraft. Over the course of 24 hours, the swarm is able to craft an inviting collection of opulent, fine silk furnishings in an unoccupied space up to 15' x 15' x 15' in size. These furnishings are of excellent craftsmanship, and close inspection reveals nothing inherently unusual about them. During the crafting process, the swarm can choose any number of the furnishings' surfaces to possess the same sticking properties as a standard spider web (escape DC 13).
  The swarm is able to hide beneath, behind, or within these furnishings, gaining advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to do so. Additionally, the swarm treats any of these silk items as if they were webs for the purposes of Web Sense and Web Walking.
Spider Climb. The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice-versa, and the swarm can move through any opening wide enough for a single Tiny spider. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
Web Sense. While in contact with a web, the swarm knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
Web Walker. The swarm ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The swarm makes an attack with bites against each creature within its space.
Bites. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 0', one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.
  If a creature is killed by this attack and its corpse remains within the swarm's lair, its body becomes desiccated and is implanted with countless tiny eggsacs. After at least 3 days have passed since death, if the corpse is disturbed, a new swarm hatches and attacks any nearby non-spider creatures.

Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice-versa, and the swarm can move through any opening wide enough for a single Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
Phasing (Recharge 5-6) As a bonus action, the swarm may become incorporeal, making itself intangible and invisible until the end of its next turn. The swarm may end this effect early as a free action.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The swarm makes 1d4 fire mote attacks. If the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, it makes 1d4 - 2 (minimum 1) fire mote attacks instead.
Fire Mote. One of the insects produces a tiny, red-hot speck of flame which flares brightly upon making contact with a creature or object. If there are no other creatures in the swarm's space, this mote drifts to the ground, igniting any flammable material there.
Any creature occupying the same space as the swarm when it makes this attack must succeed on a DC 8 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 fire damage and be set on fire. A creature who is on fire takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, and may repeat the saving throw each turn to end this effect.

Pacifism. Starting at the beginning of an encounter, for as long as Tashre does not move or take actions, any creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or greater makes attack rolls against him with disadvantage. If such an attack hits and Tashre does not trigger a reaction from him, the attacking creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by him for 1 minute, or until Tashre makes an attack against the creature or one of its allies.

Devastating Critical. When Thok scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, he can roll two additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage.
Magic Weapon Lust. Thok has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to identify, or detect magical properties of magic weapons that he can see. Additionally, the first time Thok sees a creature carrying a new weapon that he recognizes as magic, he must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.
  On a failure, he treats that creature as hostile and is compelled to act (in some way or another) on his ambitions to possess that weapon. On a success, he resists these urges and is not required to make further saving throws for that creature, unless he sees them in possession of a different magic weapon. Thok can choose to fail any of these saving throws.
Rage (4/day). On his turn, Thok can use his bonus action to fly into a rage. While raging, Thok gains the following benefits:
Has advantage on all Strength checks and saving throws.
Deals an extra 3 damage on all weapon attacks.
Gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
Gains immunity to Charm and Fear effects, and if he is suffering either of these when he enters a rage, they end for him immediately.
  Thok's rage lasts for 1 minute, until he ends it as bonus action, is knocked unconscious, or ends his turn after neither taking damage or attacking a hostile creature since the beginning of his previous turn.
Reckless. At the start of his turn, Thok can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls he makes during that turn, but attack rolls against him have advantage until the start of his next turn.
Unarmored Defense. While Thok is wearing no armor, his AC includes his Constitution modifier.
Uncanny Instincts. Thok has advantage on initiative rolls and cannot be surprised. Additionally, he has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against any traps, attacks or similar effects that he can see.
Javelin of Lightning (1/day). When Thok makes a ranged attack with this javelin, he can speak its command word and it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from him to a target within 120'. Each creature in the line excluding him and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. If this attack hit the original target, it takes normal damage from the javelin plus an extra 14 (4d6) lightning damage.

--Actions--
Multiattack. Thok makes two weapon attacks, or three if he is raging.
+2 Greatsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 5', one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage. This is a magical weapon attack.
Javelin of Lightning. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5' or range 30/120', one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. This is a magical weapon attack.

Branching Arms (Recharge 5-6). The monster's forearms, wrists, and even fingers are constantly splitting and branching into new horrifying limbs, forming a disgusting tangle of spindly, sinewy limbs. It starts with 3 arms, and if able, at the start of each of its turns it splits one of its existing appendages in two, gaining a new limb. Additionally at the start of its turn, if the monster has taken at least 15 slashing damage since its last turn, it loses one of its arms. If the monster is reduced to 0 limbs, it may grow a new one even if this trait has not recharged; if it has recharged, it regrows two limbs at this point instead.
Magic Resistance. The monster has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The monster makes a Mad Touch attack for each limb it currently has.
Mad Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage, plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suddenly perceive everything as hilariously funny and fall into fits of laughter as if affected by a Tasha's Hideous Laughter spell.
  The target is prone and incapacitated while this spell affects it, and may repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage. The target has advantage on this saving throw if it was triggered by damage. On a success, the target is no longer affected by this attack.
Dark Tendrils. Dark, shadowy tendrils erupt from the ground near a target within 30' of the monster and lash at it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.
Shadow Step. As a bonus action, while in an area of dim light or darkness, the monster may teleport to an unoccupied space it can see within 60' of it, provided the destination space is also in dim light or darkness.

Keen Smell. The swarm has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.

--Actions--
Bore. Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit, range 0', one target. Hit: 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If this attack is used on an object or a solid surface, the swarm carves a cylinder into that surface with radius and depth equal to 1" for each piercing damage done by this attack. If the attack deals damage to a creature wearing nonmagical armor, that creature's armor suffers a permanent -1 penalty to AC which is cumulative with other Bore attacks. A piece of armor which sustains a cumulative -3 penalty this way is destroyed.
Cover and Consume. The swarm continually makes hundreds or thousands of tiny bites against any other creature it comes in contact with. At the start of the swarm's turn, it deals an amount of piercing damage to each creature that is at least partially within its space, according to that creature's size: 5 (2d4) for Tiny creatures, 7 (2d6) for Small creatures, 9 (2d8) for Medium, 11 (2d10) for Large, 13 (2d12) for Huge, and 21 (2d20) for Gargantuan. This damage ignores any resistance or immunity to piercing damage not specified as from nonmagical weapons.

Junk Hoard. Trash pandas are almost always found carrying a junk hoard consisting of a bundle of items (usually of questionable value). The hoard contains 1d6+2 items determined randomly from the table below (or chosen by the DM). Trash pandas treasure each and every item in their hoard (especially if they are shiny), protecting them with their life. They do not relinquish them lightly, usually doing so only in exchange for something of greater perceived value, or as a sincere token of gratitude.

Disease Carrier. The trash panda has advantage on Constitution saving throws to avoid contracting disease. If the trash panda makes such a check with advantage and succeeds while the lower (ignored) result would have failed, the trash panda becomes a carrier for that disease. If a trash panda is a carrier for a disease, it suffers no adverse effects from that disease, but otherwise is treated as if it were infected (e.g. for purposes of infecting other creatures, being cured, etc.).

Devil's Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.
Magic Resistance. The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Plant Corruption. Plants in the devil's path turn a sickly shade of brown and they seem to writhe and squirm in its presence. Any nonmagical foliage such as vines, shrubs or even especially tall grass within 60' of the devil becomes difficult terrain for all creatures except for the devil. Additionally, any creatures of the 'plant' type that begin their turn within this radius must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the devil for 24 hours. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours
Speak with Plants. The devil can communicate with plants as if they shared a language.
Tree Stride. Once on its turn, the devil can use 10' of its movement to step magically into one living tree within its reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60' of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5' of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The devil makes two Claw attacks.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage, and 4 (1d8) poison damage.
Fiendish Vines (Recharge 5-6). The devil chooses a spot of exposed earth within 30' that it can see, and the space fills with black, thorned vines which erupt from the ground. Each creature within 5' of this space must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained. A creature restrained by the vines takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and may use its action to make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check, ending the effects on a success.
  The space persists until no creatures are affected by this ability, and any creature other than the devil that starts its turn or moves within 5' of the space must succeed on the same Dexterity saving throw or suffer this ability's effects. If at the start of the devil's turn, no creatures are affected by the vines, they withdraw back into the earth.

Edit: slight adjustments to Fiendish Vines, and altered the Plant Corruption trait to include effects for plant-type creatures.

Earth Walk. The dragon can move across and climb surfaces composed of sand, rocks, or dirt without making an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain resulting from sand or rocks does not cost the dragon extra movement.
Sand Eruption. When the dragon emerges from burrowing beneath the sand, it does so with tremendous force. The dragon may emerge from the sand in another creature's space. Any creatures within 5' of the dragon's space when it emerges must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage, is pushed 10', and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space, takes no damage, and is not knocked prone.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
Sand Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dragon emits a blast of stinging, choking sand in a 30' cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) slashing damage on a failure, half as much on a success. A cloud of swirling sand remains in a 15' radius sphere containing the area of effect of this attack. The cloud is opaque and blocks line of sight into or past it, and any creatures within the cloud are blinded. The cloud persists for 1d4 rounds, or until the start of the dragon's next turn if there is any wind in the area.

--Actions--
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.
Venomous Barb (1/Day). +5 to hit, reach 0', one creature the gremlin is touching. Hit: The gremlin attaches to the target, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until 1 minute after the gremlin is detached, up to a maximum total of 6 hours. While the target is poisoned, it is anesthetized so that it does not feel the barb, the gremlin's grip on its body, or any sensation resulting from this poisoned condition.
  Additionally, for each hour the gremlin is attached, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 2d4, and the target receives an amount of temporary hit points equal to the cumulative total of this reduction. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest, or until it is cured by a lesser restoration spell or greater, and a target whose hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect dies. Any temporary hit points from this effect are removed when the poison ends.
 
A venomous pygmy gremlin is a small, furry creature whose innocent appearance belies its insidious nature. Concealed within folds of skin on the gremlin's belly is a pliable filament of sinew tipped with a very thin and very sharp hooked barb. This appendage, when it punctures a host creature, dispenses an anesthetizing venom which allows the gremlin to cling to its host and subsequently feed from it without its knowledge. Cases have been recorded of creatures being killed from exsanguination from such a gremlin, presumably unaware of the parasite right up until the time of death.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). If the boar takes 8 or less damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points or fewer, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

False Appearance. While motionless and lying down, the wyvern appears to be a pile of logs or driftwood.
Siege Monster. The wyvern deals double damage to objects and structures.

Amphibious. The dragon can breathe air and water.
Plant Camouflage. Many of the dragon's scales are tipped in frilled green fringes resembling leaves and ferns, granting it advantage on saving throws while obscured by foliage or undergrowth. Its round, oval body also vaguely resembles some kind of large fruit, notoriously allowing it to hide in fruit patches or fruit wagons.

--Actions--
Multiattack. The dragon makes two melee attacks: one of which may be a Bite attack.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5', one target. Hit:5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
Juice Spray (Recharge 5-6). The dragon breathes a spray of bitter, odd-tasting juice in a 15' cone. Each creature within this area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in this juice for 1d4 hours. A creature coated in this acrid-smelling juice smells funny (and is weirded out).
A creature who smells funny must succeed a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw each time it wishes to perform an action other than trying to remove the juice from its body (either by wiping it off, or by rinsing it off with a carried liquid or by jumping in a nearby body of water). A creature who fails this saving throw may not take an action this round, as they instead compulsively try to clean the juice from their person, though they may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending this compulsion on a success. An ally within 5' of a creature who smells funny must succeed on the same Wisdom saving throw or, on their next turn, use some of their movement to position themselves more than 5' of the creature if able. A creature coated in juice may end all associated effects by spending a short rest bathing in water, or rinsing itself with alcohol or vinegar.
